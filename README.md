Press f3 to open the debug screen and f9 to kill the program. 

The Config.java file contains a lot of useful configurable variables. 
Such as:
- disabling fullscreen: WINDOW_FULLSCREEN
- making the window resizable: WINDOW_RESIZABLE
- disabling cutscenes: DISABLE_CUTSCENES
- disabling sounds: DISABLE_SOUNDS
- printing fps: PRINT_ACTUAL_FPS
- changing keybinds: *all variables under //KEYS*
- changing the startup state (will change how the program starts): START_UP_STATE


ENJOY!
