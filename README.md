Helpful extra controlls:
- Press f3 to open the debug screen and f9 to kill the program. 
- Press Esc during a cutscene to skip it. 
- Hold Q to spam attack

The Config.java file contains a lot of useful configurable variables. 
Such as:
- disabling fullscreen: WINDOW_FULLSCREEN
- making the window resizable (will not resize the actual graphics): WINDOW_RESIZABLE
- disabling cutscenes: DISABLE_CUTSCENES
- disabling sounds: DISABLE_SOUNDS
- printing fps: PRINT_ACTUAL_FPS
- changing keybinds: *all variables under //KEYS*
- changing the startup state (will change how the program starts): START_UP_STATE

Btw, this game does have some sound. Play with volume on :)

ENJOY!
