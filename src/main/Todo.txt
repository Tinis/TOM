Todo:
Priority HIgh:
 - implement the short story
make the nightclub bossfight
meaning:
      make the nightclublevel
      make a shooting ai that walks in a pattern and shoots. 
      make the art for idling walking and shooting in all directions. 
      i can make him shoot alot when he walks vertically and stop shooting when he walks horizontally. 
make a small cutscene to transition to sleeping 
(maybe its blacktext-screen=>sleepingtom=>blacktext-screen=>luciddreamplace=>new boss fight)
make the last bossfight:
meaning:
      make the luciddreamlevel
      make a blob with shitty animation (that teleports around (i.e has very high speed))
      make the last cutscene with hugging the dad (phone notes has more instructions)

 - legg til tekst under dei første trappane ("left click to interact with the stairs")
make shooting do more damage
 
 - lag ein liten video av spelet for innleveringen. 
Bonuspoeng: Dere får 1 poeng for å inkludere en video av applikasjonen. Last den opp på f.eks. 
Youtube (videoen kan være privat) og legg til en link i README.md.

add to the defeated family cutscene ("oh hey btw press R to rip out a feather and throw it at people")

Priority Medium:
 - implement cooldowns (this may fix the weird bug that happens when spamming fire). 
 - make awake theme play when waking up (meaning shorten the lucid dream file in audacity)
 - make a text show up on screen with the next objective
 - (make an ability where you can pull a feather out of the pillow and throw it on people 
 - (exactly like shooting))
 - fix dashing so that the new destination is set before the moving happens. 
 Also its completely broken and the speed gets fucked. 
 if you dash whilst standing still, you lose speed. 
 - make targetable property actually work. 
 - make a red vignett when you have low health. 
 - make a dying cutscene. 
 - make the health regenerate
 - make characters blink when they get hit. 
 - make some interactions get highlighted when hovered.
 - make it so that i can make the entire world a sprite. 
 this can be done in the view because it doesn't change based on anything.
 (make a computerscreen in the room that has a screwy screen)
 - make some sort of cutScene ai that makes the characters do a cutScene.
 - make more fighting abilities (block dash heavy (or ranged))
 - make cooldowns for abilities. maybe have a list of abilites on cooldown. 
 - make the story longer.
 - make it so that characters stop walking action when they hit a wall. 
 - fastlege, bank an for medisin 
 - sound is acting weird. Sometimes it just doesn't play. 
 it happened know because i played the cutscene and then went back to the menu, 
 and then back to start. 
 - make it so that the interactions are animated. 


Priority Low:
 - make more items? like boots and shit.
 - lighting.
 - emotes :D
 - make the player animations better. 
 - make buttons highlightable.


debugging learning:
 - i may have two coordinate point converters at times. 
    meaning that the listener should be the model so that it always changes the actual active one.
 - sometimes the view may try to draw a projectile that no longer exists 
 (or at least for whatever reason has the pos-coordinate null, it probably does exist)
 - sometimes the drawProjectiles method raises a concurrent modification exception (why? we dont know)
