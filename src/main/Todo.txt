Todo:
Priority HIgh:

Priority Medium:
 - implement cooldowns (this may fix the weird bug that happens when spamming fire). 
 - make awake theme play when waking up (meaning shorten the lucid dream file in audacity)
 - make targetable property actually work and make blocking. 
 - make a red vignett when you have low health. 
 - make a dying cutscene. 
 - make the health regenerate
 - make characters blink when they get hit. 
 - make some interactions get highlighted when hovered.
 this can be done in the view because it doesn't change based on anything.
 (make a computerscreen in the room that has a screwy screen)
 - make some sort of cutScene ai that makes the characters do a cutScene.
 - make more fighting abilities (block dash heavy (or ranged))
 - make cooldowns for abilities. maybe have a list of abilites on cooldown. 
 - make the story longer.
 - make it so that characters stop walking action when they hit a wall. 
 - fastlege, bank an for medisin 
 - sound is acting weird. Sometimes it just doesn't play. 
 it happened know because i played the cutscene and then went back to the menu, 
 and then back to start. 
 - make it so that the interactions are animated. 


Priority Low:
 - make more items? like boots and shit.
 - lighting.
 - emotes :D
 - make the player animations better. 
 - make buttons highlightable.


debugging learning:
 - i may have two coordinate point converters at times. 
    meaning that the listener should be the model so that it always changes the actual active one.
 - sometimes the view may try to draw a projectile that no longer exists 
 (or at least for whatever reason has the pos-coordinate null, it probably does exist)
 - sometimes the drawProjectiles method raises a concurrent modification exception (why? we dont know)
