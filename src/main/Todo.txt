Todo:
Priority HIgh:
 - implement the short story
 - make some art and add some music (just kinda demo music rly)
 - make a pistol shooter boss fight that dashes around you :D (nightclub owner) 
 - (he shoots a lot and has to reload)


Priority Medium:
 - make it so that characters stop walking action when they hit a wall. 
 - (make an ability where you can pull a feather out of the pillow and throw it on people 
 - (exactly like shooting))
 - fix dashing so that the new destination is set before the moving happens. 
 Also its completely broken and the speed gets fucked. 
 if you dash whilst standing still, you lose speed. 
 - make targetable property actually work. 
 - make a red vignett when you have low health. 
 - make a dying cutscene. 
 - make the health regenerate
 - make characters blink when they get hit. 
 - make some interactions get highlighted when hovered.
 - make it so that i can make the entire world a sprite. 
 this can be done in the view because it doesn't change based on anything.
 (make a computerscreen in the room that has a screwy screen)
 - make some sort of cutScene ai that makes the characters do a cutScene.
 - make more fighting abilities (block dash heavy (or ranged))
 - make cooldowns for abilities. maybe have a list of abilites on cooldown. 
 - make the story longer.
 - fastlege banke an for medisin 


Priority Low:
 - make more items? like boots and shit.
 - lighting.
 - emotes :D
 - make the player animations better. 
 - make buttons highlightable.


debugging learning:
 - i may have two coordinate point converters at times. 
    meaning that the listener should be the model so that it always changes the actual active one.
