All names are all lowercase with no spaces. 

Level- screen- and other- images should have the
same name as the corresponding objects in the program. 
For example the level image corresponding to the level 
"bedroom1" is called "bedroom1.png" 
(the filetype doesn't really matter but i use .png).

Sprite images (by which i mean frames of animations)
should be named with this format:
"character_facing_action_state"
the state count begins at 1.
For example "tom_south_idle_1"
(remember "tom_south_idle_0" is not supposed to exist
 even though the action states start counting at 0 [meaning the idle has a 0-state].)
