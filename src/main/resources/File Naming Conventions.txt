All names are all lowercase with no spaces. 

Level- screen- and other- images should have the
same name as the corresponding objects in the program. 
For example the screen image corresponding to the screen
"howtoplay" is called "howtoplay.png" 
(the filetype doesn't really matter but i use .png).

Levels can be animated. The images are named as such:
"levelname_state". So since the level bedroom1 only has one state the image is called bedroom1_1.png
remember to add the framesPerState number to the findLevelFramesPerState method in TomModel.java


Sprite images (by which i mean frames of animations)
should be named with this format:
"character_facing_action_state"
the state count begins at 1.
For example "tom_south_idle_1"
(remember "tom_south_idle_0" is not supposed to exist
 even though the action states start counting at 0 [meaning the idle has a 0-state].)

Cutscene images should be named with this format:
"name_number" 
name is the name of the cutscene. 
number is to be replaced with whatever number frame this is in the cutscene starts count at 1. 

sounds should just be called whatever they are called but always be .wav files. 

Other sprites such as the projectile should be named like this:
"name_number" same as cutscene images.
